             <h4>About Us</h4>
             <p>PR Foundation was born to bridge the gap between the people who want to make a difference through giving back and those who are<br> doing phenomenal work but need more support. Our focus has been to build trust for the social sector by strong 
                due diligence of<br> all our nonprofit partners, and transparency on how donations impacted lives on the ground.
